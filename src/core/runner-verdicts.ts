/**
 * "Is this background task's runner still alive?" — the one place that question is
 * answered, for every process that asks (TUI, monitor, bridge).
 *
 * Three properties drive the design:
 *
 * 1. It is a fact about OTHER processes, so it is inherently cross-process and its
 *    natural home is disk. An in-memory verdict cache only helps a process that
 *    outlives the probe — and the TUI does not: launched via `tmux display-popup`
 *    it is a fresh process on every open, so it re-proved the same permanently-dead
 *    verdicts on every launch.
 * 2. Death is terminal — a runner never revives. So a dead verdict is written once
 *    and never probed again by anyone. An alive verdict re-probes after a short TTL
 *    to notice the runner exiting.
 * 3. The writers run concurrently and each sees a different slice of tasks. So
 *    verdicts are stored one file per task (atomic temp+rename), exactly as
 *    `savePaneSessions` stores one file per pane: independent keys never contend,
 *    which removes the read-modify-write race by construction instead of narrowing
 *    it. A single shared JSON file cannot do this — two callers both re-read before
 *    either writes, and the loser's slice is silently dropped.
 *
 * Verdicts key on the harness task id, which is unique per task, so the store is
 * flat rather than per-session — that is what lets `liveScripts` (which only has
 * tasks, no session id) share it with the session-level parse cache.

 * says "pending" forever (seen in real data: a 3-day-old wait on a live pane), and
 * this probe is what catches it.
 *
 * One `lsof` for the whole set, not one per path. `lsof` walks every process's fd
 * table, so it costs ~115ms regardless of how many paths it is asked about — probing
 * serially made the cost scale with the number of orphaned tasks (7 accumulated
 * orphans measured at 807ms; batched, 118ms). It is also the more honest answer: a
 * single consistent snapshot rather than N snapshots smeared across a second.
 *
 * Paths absent from the output read dead, which folds in the missing-file case
 * (tmp pruned, reboot) for free.
