/**
 * "Is this session waiting on a background script?" — the ⏳ badge, for every caller.
 *
 * Two caches sit behind the answer, split by what they actually key on:
 *  - this file: the per-session TRANSCRIPT PARSE, keyed by (size, mtime). A full
 *    transcript read only happens when a candidate's transcript changes.
 *  - `runner-verdicts.ts`: the per-task LIVENESS verdict, keyed by task id. Shared
 *    with `liveScripts`, which has tasks but no session id.
 *
 * Both are on disk because none of the callers outlive the work: the monitor is a
 * fresh process per tmux status tick, and the TUI is a fresh process per
 * `display-popup` open. Steady-state cost per call is one stat per candidate session,
 * and one `lsof` for all genuinely-live runners every ~15s.
 *
 * Note the two use different concurrency strategies, deliberately. Verdicts get one
 * file per task because a lost verdict costs a fresh ~115ms `lsof` and is a fact about
 * a process that may since have exited. This file stays a single JSON document under
 * last-write-wins: it is a pure memo of the transcript, so the worst a lost entry can
 * do is force one re-read that reproduces exactly the same answer.
